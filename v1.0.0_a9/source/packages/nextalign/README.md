See the command-line version in <a href="../nextalign_cli">nextalign_cli</a> for more details.

Currently we don't support using this library outside `nextalign_cli` and `nextclade_cli`, but it does not mean it's impossible. If you want to build a project on top of `nextalign`, we would be glad to hear about your use-case and experience.
